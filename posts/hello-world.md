## Welcome to my blog

My blog will become a space where I share all my knowledge with the world.

I too was a developer beginning my journey and I hope to help those looking for assistance too.

### A little about me

I've been a web developer for around 8 years now, starting my career as a freelance web developer under the name JAK DIGITAL. From there I got my first job at Studio Chriate where I built WordPress websites, then joined the team at RAAK Creative where I build headless websites with Gatsby and Nuxt.

I love building websites with the latest technology and finding ways to simplify the development process.
